# Tempel

### Data security framework for Clojure

**Tempel** is a lightweight encryption framework that wraps the JVM's native crypto facilities to provide a **high-level Clojure API** that is: idiomatic, simple, and **easy-to-use** even for non-experts.

It incorporates **best practices and reasonable defaults** to help simplify many common data security needs.

## Latest release/s

- `2024-MM-DD` `1.0.0-beta1`: [release notes](../../releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta1)

[![Main tests][Main tests SVG]][Main tests URL]
[![Graal tests][Graal tests SVG]][Graal tests URL]

See [here][GitHub releases] for earlier releases.

## Why Tempel?

- **Easy-to-use, high-level API** focused on [common tasks](../../wiki/2-Examples) like logins, encryption, signing, etc.
- **Reasonable defaults** including choice of algorithms and work factors
- **Future-proof data formats** with auto-updated algorithms and work factors over time
- Support for [‚ßâ symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm), [‚ßâ asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) (public-key), and [‚ßâ end-to-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) (E2EE) encryption
- Automatic [‚ßâ scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) and [‚ßâ pbkdf2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) support for easy **password-based key stretching**
- Simple **key management API** for password resets, key rotations, etc.
- Beginner-oriented [documentation](#documentation) and docstrings
- **Comprehensive test suite** with >60k unit tests

Note that Tempel is [not intended](../../wiki/3-Faq#can-i-decrypt-tempel-data-with-other-tools) for interop with other cryptographic tools/APIs.

## Roadmap

Tempel has a fixed scope, and is **fully complete**. I'm happy with its design and implementation, and believe it meets all its objectives in its current form. I'm not anticipating significant changes.

Still, given the sensitivity of the problem domain, I plan to approach Tempel's official stable release as a phased rollout to allow time for feedback before locking things down:

| Phase | Date    | Release       | Appropriate for
| :-:   | :--     | :--           | :--
|       | 2023-11 | `v1.0-alpha`  | Dev/testing with disposable data
|  ‚û§    | 2024-01 | `v1.0-beta`   | Dev/testing with disposable data
|       | 2024-03 | `v1.0-RC`     | Staging, with ephemeral or low-value data
|       | 2024-05 | `v1.0` final  | Production, with real data

`v1.0` final will be considered "**done**"- the library is expected to need+see only minimal maintance from that point.

## Disclaimer

**Important**: while Tempel has been written and tested with care, the nature of the problem domain inevitably means that bugs and/or misuse can be **especially harmful and/or easy to make**.

Bugs and/or misuse could lead to [security vulnerabilities](../../wiki/3-FAQ#how-secure-is-tempel) or even [permanent data loss](../../wiki/3-FAQ#is-there-a-risk-of-data-loss).

Please be **very careful** evaluating Tempel and/or other cryptographic libraries/frameworks before use, especially new libraries/frameworks like Tempel!
